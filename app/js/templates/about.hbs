Where in Queens is based on <a href="http://www.link-sf.org"> Link-SF</a>, a project designed and implemented by  <a href="http://www.stanthonysf.org/">St. Anthony Foundation</a>, Zendesk, and user testing expert <a href="http://kimberlymccollister.com/design/">Kimberly McCollister</a>. This collaboration emerged as a result of the Community Benefits Agreement within the Mid-Market revitalization project in the city of San Francisco.  St. Anthonyâ€™s Tenderloin Technology Lab reached out to the tech community after observing an increase in the use of smart phones by low-income residents. Link-SF is a result of this process and is an attempt to use mobile technology to assist those most in need.

      Zendesk is a cloud-based customer service platform. It is designed to be easy to use, easy to customize, and easy to scale. Frustrated with the state of enterprise customer service software in 2007, three Danish entrepreneurs sought out to create beautifully simple software that could change how any company interacted with its customers. Today more than 30,000 companies use Zendesk to provide service to more than 200 million people worldwide.
